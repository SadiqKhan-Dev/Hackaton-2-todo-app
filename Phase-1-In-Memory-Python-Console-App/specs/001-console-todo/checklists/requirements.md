# Specification Quality Checklist: In-Memory Python Console Todo App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All validation items pass. Specification is ready for `/sp.clarify` (if needed) or `/sp.plan`.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain. All requirements are complete and well-defined.
- User stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3) with independent test scenarios for each.
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic.
- Edge cases are identified and will be addressed in implementation.
- Scope is clearly bounded with explicit in-scope and out-of-scope lists.
- Assumptions are documented for context.
